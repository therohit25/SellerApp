You can search for cars by their name using the search bar.

The pagination allows you to navigate through the car listings.

Car Card Layout
Car cards are listed in rows with 3 cards per row, displaying a maximum of 6 cards at a time.
Each car card is designed to resemble the provided image, with a similar but not pixel-perfect appearance.

Pagination Controls
Pagination includes Next and Previous buttons for easy navigation.
Page numbers are displayed for quick access.
